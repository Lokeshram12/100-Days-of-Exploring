Fetch API is a modern, promise‐based interface for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. It replaces the older XMLHttpRequest (XHR) API with a cleaner, more flexible syntax.

1. How Fetch Works
Promise‐based: Returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object.

Streamable: You can read response bodies as streams.

Configurable: Supports request methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.), headers, credentials, timeouts (via AbortController), and more.

2. Real-World Use Cases
Fetching JSON data from a REST API (e.g. loading a list of users or products).

Submitting form data without a full page reload (AJAX style).

Lazy loading images or content as the user scrolls.

Polling or streaming real-time updates (e.g. chat messages).

File uploads/downloads with progress tracking.
